# RookieRobot
## 💡INSPIRATION💡
Our team is comprised of undergraduate students looking for exposure to cloud technology. We wanted to use Google Cloud specifically for storage and hosting purposes. We thought an automated application that uses Twitter to share inspirational quotes could be designed around this technology and welcomed the challenge.

## ⚙️WHAT IT DOES⚙️
Rookie Robot has a list of quotes stored in Google Sheets. When a user inputs a Twitter handle, it will follow that user, tag them, and create a post with a quote from that list.

## 📚 WHAT WE LEARNED 📚
We learned new skills by applying Python and Flask to build our back-end service, and HTML and CSS to build our front-end. Using the Twitter and Google Sheets APIs, we learned about integrating multiple APIs to produce the results. Finally, we learned about how to host a web app on the cloud using Google Compute Engine.

## 🛠️HOW WE BUILT IT🛠️
We used Python and Flask for processing user interactions. We built the web page using HTML and CSS. The web app is hosted on Google Cloud Compute Engine's VPS.

## 😣 CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO😣
Twitter API 🐦: this API was updated recently and existing resources could not be used fully. The documentation was difficult to understand.

GitHub 🐾: we are still learning how to use this platform, and one of our members had accidentally committed the wrong files causing us to lose some time.

Act of God ⛈️: one of members had a power outage in his neighboured due to damaged lines from a storm. They could not participate during a large portion of the event.
