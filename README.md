# RookieRobot
## 💡INSPIRATION💡
Our team comprise of undergraduate students looking for exposure to cloud technology. We wanted to use Google Cloud specifically for storage and hosting purposes. We thought that an automated application that uses twitter to share inspirational quotes could be designed around this technology and welcomed the challenge.

## ⚙️WHAT IT DOES⚙️
Rookie Robot has a list of quotes stored in Google Sheets. When a user inputs a twitter handle it will follow that user, tag them, and create a post with a quote from that list.

## 📚 WHAT WE LEARNED 📚
Majority of our group were learning Flask, Python, HTML, or CSS. The Twitter API and Google Sheets API were new to everyone, as well as Google Cloud.

## 🛠️HOW WE BUILT IT🛠️
Our project was designed using Python, we also built a web page with flask to allow users to interact with Rookie Robot. The web page is hosted on Google Cloud.

## 😣 CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO😣
Twitter API, this API was updated recently and existing resources could not be used fully. The documentation was difficult to interpret and implement.

GitHub, we are still learning how to use this platform and one of our members had accidentally committed the wrong files causing us to lose some time.

Act of God, one of members had a power outage in his neighboured due to damaged lines from a storm. They could not participate during a large portion of the event.
